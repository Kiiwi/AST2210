For this part, we set a lens with intentional barrel distortion 
attached to a monochromatic camera, and had a checkerboard 
patterned sheet 235 mm in front of the lens, resulting in figure /vref{fig:barrel}

Distortion can be very irregular, but follow a few patterns, mainly
pincushion and barrel distortion. Pincushion distortion happens when 
image magnification is incresed radially away from the optical axis. 
Barrel distortion is the opposite: Magnification decreases radially
from the optical axis.
