Coma, or comatic aberration, refers to when imperfect lenses 
(or other components) cause the image projection of an off-axis 
light source to be distorted in a way that makes the light source
appear to have a trail of blurry circles directed away from the 
optical axis. For this experiment, we used a lens specificially 
designed to give coma. 

In the figure \vref{fig:coma}, we see the idea behind coma, 
simply that the incoming light rays

Looking at figure \vref{fig:coma2}, we clearly see the aforementioned
