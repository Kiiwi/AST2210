The focal lengths for the aberration lenses we used. This is roughly where we placed the secondary lens.
spherical+chromatic 30cm
coma                15cm
astigmatism         10cm

The mm lengths in the filenames indicate additional fine tuning of the secondary lens. What matters is only the difference between these lengths for each experiment. The margin of error for these measurements are +/- 0.3mm. Increasing length means increasing distance between primary(aberration) and secondary lens.

I changed some of the filenames we wrote at the lab and ordered everything in folders to make it more systematic. If I have done something you don't understand, please ask me.
