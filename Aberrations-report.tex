\section{Introduction}

In this lab exercise we will explore the five of the most common optical
aberrations that occur when light travels through an optical system. These
aberrations are chromatic aberration, and the Seidel aberrations spherical,
coma, astigmatism and barrel/pincushion distortion.

We will produce each of these aberrations intentionally, display how they
appear, and discuss why they appear as they do.


\section{Instruments}

The aberrations we have examined can be divided into mono-chromatic and
chromatic aberrations, therefore
we used two different cameras: An Edmund Optics USB camera
and a mono-chromatic Edmund Optics USB camera.
The colour camera was used in conjunction with a white light lamp,
while the black-and-white camera was used with a laser.
For the chromatic and spherical experiments we used a thin singlet lens with a
focal length of approximately $30 \U{cm}$.
For the coma experiment a specially designed lens with a focal length of $15
\U{cm}$ was used. To illustrate astigmatism we used a thick doublet lens with a
focal length of $10 \U{cm}$.
In combination with these three lenses we had a microscope objective as a
secondary lens, to act as the camera's objective.
For the distortion experiment a lens with a strong barrel distortion effect
which was attached directly to the camera with an adapter.

\section{Errors}
Distances were measure by hand with a ruler. With an estimated guess in the lab
we say that the margin of error in the offset measurements is $\pm 0.3 \U{mm}$.
The distances between our instruments is only vaguely given, or given in a
rough number of centimetres.
The analysis of our results is primarily qualitative, not quantitative.
Our discussions have been based on describing what kind of visual effects the
different kinds of aberrations created, and that is why we accepted to not make
very accurate measurements of our setup and results.
