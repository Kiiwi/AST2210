For this part, we set a white light lamp to send its light through
a lens on a mount with adjustable tilt, and to a monochromatic camera
linked to the computer. Later in the experiment, we added a circular
aperture between the lamp and the lens. The focal length of this lens is
$150 \U{mm}$, and this is roughly where we placed the secondary lens.

Coma, or comatic aberration, refers to when imperfect lenses 
(or other components) cause the image projection of an off-axis 
light source to be distorted in a way that makes the light source
appear to have a trail of blurry circles directed away from the 
optical axis. For this experiment, we used a lens specificially 
designed to give coma. 

In the figure \vref{fig:coma}, we see the idea behind coma, 
simply that the incoming light rays doesn't get focused to the same point.

Looking at figures \vref{fig:coma1}-\vref{fig:coma3}, we clearly see
the aforementioned trail, resulting in a very blurry and unfocused light dot.

We now introduce a circular aperture, placed between the light source and the
lens.

In figure \vref{fig:ap1}, the aperture was set to 19 mm, and we already see
a much clearer image. Coma is still very present, but reducing the aperture
further to 10 mm, and we have a nice and clear dot. The trails are heavily 
reduced, if not gone, due to the aperture filtering out the light rays that 
are "most" off-axis, so that we collect the ones that are the most focused.
